Prefer simple solution changes and readable code over shorter code 
Do not perform global changes across many files without asking
Keep it simple
When suggesting to run test in shell, use "py" instead of "python"
prefer creating classes/new files for better maintenance

This is a set of start project learning pack for NLP/asking
There are various small projects, each with a different focus

- Use classes, each solution will have main.py entry point
- Make sure code is well documented and easy to understand
- Use requirements.txt for dependencies
- Use .gitignore to ignore unnecessary files

**Documentation requirements for each project:**
- Each project must have two markdown files:
    1. A non-technical, high-level explanation of what the project does (suggested name: `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` or `ABOUT.md`).
    2. A technical usage guide with instructions on how to run the code (suggested name: `USAGE.md` or `GETTING_STARTED.md`).
- The root project will have a README.md file with instructions on how to run code from each project.
- Do not perform global changes across many files without asking.
