# Sentiment Analyzer: Project Overview

The Sentiment Analyzer is a simple tool that helps you understand whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative feeling. It is designed for general English text, such as reviews, comments, or emails. You do not need any technical background to use itâ€”just provide your text, and the tool will tell you if the sentiment is positive or negative.

This project uses a well-known method called VADER, which is especially good at analyzing the tone of short texts and social media posts. No training or setup is required beyond installing the necessary software.

Use this tool to quickly gauge the mood of written content, whether for fun, research, or business insights.
