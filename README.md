# my-ai-notebook

Welcome to **my-ai-notebook**!  
This is my personal repository for learning, experimenting, and documenting concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

## 📝 About

This project is a collection of:
- Small, self-contained projects and experiments
- Notes and explanations on AI/ML/NLP concepts
- Practical scripts and notebooks for hands-on learning

It's intended for personal growth, exploration, and as a reference for future projects.

## 📂 Structure

- `projects/` — Each subfolder is a separate mini-project (e.g., sentiment analysis, classification, etc.)
- `notes/` — Markdown files with theory, observations, and learning logs
- `data/` — Sample datasets (if not too large)
- `scripts/` — General-purpose Python scripts and utilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/petrbu/my-ai-notebook.git
   cd my-ai-notebook
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Explore a project:**
   - Go to the `projects/` directory and pick a subfolder to start experimenting.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Basic NLP (tokenization, sentiment analysis, etc.)
- Machine Learning (classification, regression)
- Text preprocessing
- Using libraries like NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, etc.
- Notes, summaries, and references
